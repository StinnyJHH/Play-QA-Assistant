## Automate and Improve QA process

This application was specifically used to organize Google Sheets data (where QA was processed).
Prior to this application, devs and project manager would have to manually update and relocate known bugs and debugged bugs.
This application automates the process of organizing the data provided on the sheets by:
* Moving solved bugs over to a separate archive sheet
* Providing visual graphs of analytics in various useful ways
  * by severity
  * by categories of bugs
  * by number of bugs assigned to each developer
